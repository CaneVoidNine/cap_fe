My Capstone project :

Create a website using react and redux with Routes.

Idea is to create a game-like website for working out including RPG mechanics.

1. Players having skills and levels, with their own items and in-game coins to spend on looks.
2. Messages with players and in-game coaches.
3. Quests and progression based on finishing objectives given by in-game coaches.
4. A market that allows users to trade items. (?)
5. Settings to cusomize look. Profiles, friends and groups with group objectives.
6. Create a hideout that can be customized and used as group chat, hang out , play games , watch stuff.

Plan:

1. Backend startup.
