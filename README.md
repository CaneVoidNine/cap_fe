My Capstone project :

Create a website using react and redux with Routes.

Idea is to create a game-like website , online post-apocaliptic game , the main aspect of which is traversable map with locations and quests , monster , challenges. With ability to enter cities and talk to NPC's and players, heal, buy items etc. and go from location to location.
